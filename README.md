[![Build](https://github.com/pcheng17/zmkeebs/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pcheng17/zmkeebs/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository currently only contains the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) configuration for my [crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). I'm experimenting with ZMK for a few reasons:
1. ZMK conveniently sets up GitHub Actions for building your firmware.
2. ZMK allows for Bluetooth-enabled keyboards as long as you're also using the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/).
